Inspired by the `2.0` version used by _GitHub Pages_, this theme is forked and modified from [**mattgraham/leapday**](https://github.com/mattgraham/leapday), used by https://ribokit.github.io and https://t47io.github.io.

jekyll serve -w
```

### Documentation

Varibles available in the [**Front Matter**](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) block are described in detail below (or see at https://ribokit.github.io/std/#jekyll):

In your **.md** file, use a header like this:

```go

```
